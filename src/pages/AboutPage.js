With an education and background in digital design, I understand the entire process of creating quality web applications from conception to completion. In the past, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of web projects and gained invaluable experiences through daily operations within Information Technology and Creative.</p>
                        <p>Outside of the office, I tend to be the fun-loving adventurous type, always seeking new sites and taking on new types of challenges. I like to spend my time cooking, gardening, drawing, weightlifting, running, and mountain biking. Although I am passionate about living a healthy lifestyle, I do also enjoy the occasional happy hour or get together with coworkers and friends. I love to stay busy and on the move, both in and out of the workplace.</p>
